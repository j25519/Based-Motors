# Based Motors

A fun little hobby project I made and might keep working on.

Website for a fictional car dealership selling EVs for Bitcoin.

Built in React + Vite with Tailwind CSS.

All transactions are simulated since it's not a real site selling anything. But you're welcome to send a few sats to *bc1pv68x4f6dfktsppwle2dcjyxmd6ademdtcc4mrw90aeyf6k2p28zstxnvxr* if you had fun messing with this and it helped you learn a bit about React as it did for me.

It goes without saying forks are more than welcome, just make sure to credit me :)
